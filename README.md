# Fault latch for IMD and BMS/AMS

This board is a fork of [JacobParent7/FSAE_ELECTRONICS](https://github.com/JacobParent7/FSAE_ELECTRONICS/tree/main/Fault%20Latch). Thanks!

### Overview

It is stripped down for our purposes of using it just as a fault latch if either IMD or BMS signal an error. So it can open and close the SDC (Shutdown circuit).

As input it needs +12V and GND. It also takes a high input of both IMD and BMS to register a fault.

It has two outputs for LEDs, these go into the cockpit of the car, to signal issues to the driver.

Lastly there is one connection where the SDC is routed through.
